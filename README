                         ROBOT VER. 2.8
                         ==============

This game is a version of the the "Robots" type computer game, see:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_%28computer_game%29

This particular version is a re-implemtation of Allen R. Black's
"ROBOT" for the Borland Turbo Pascal IDE. It makes use of the sound
and graphics features of the Norwegian computer "Tiki-100".

It was written in 1986 and since I no longer have access to the IDE, I
can offer no guidance on how to compile it.  Please add instructions
as a pull request if you figure it out.

I've posted it on GitHub under a MIT/Expat license because there still
some retro interest in the Tiki-100 computer. see
